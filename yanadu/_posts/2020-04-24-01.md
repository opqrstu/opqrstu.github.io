## Learning contents

'where' can modify a noun to a specific place

After where, There must be S + V.

'Where' or 'a noun of the place' can be skipped in a sentence.

For example, "A place where I work", "A place I work" and "Where I work" are same sentences.

## Examples

1. I like the place where I work.
: 내가 일하는 곳이 좋아
2. The hotel I work is expensive.
: 내가 일하는 호텔은 비싸다
