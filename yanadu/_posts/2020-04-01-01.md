## Learning contents
The future progressive form : It will be doing something.
It's format is "will + be + Ving".
The pronounce of 'wil' is '을'.
Because it is easy form, I need practice to remember variable expressions

## Examples
1. I'll be talking on the phone 
: 통화중일거야
2. I'll be waring a suit 
: 정장입고있을거야
3. He'll be sitting next to me 
: 걔 내 옆에 앉아있을거야
4. I'll be flying to Newyork 
: 뉴욕으로 비행기타고가고있을거야
