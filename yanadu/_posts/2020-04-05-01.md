## Learning contents
The present perfect tense 2nd. It's means are a completion and a result. 

Native speakers think a point of a time, when I get a talk using just the past tense.

If I want to say that it's state or situation are keep until now, to add more a mean, I need to using the present perfect tense(have p.p)

## Examples
1. I've lost it 
: 나그거잃어버렸어(지금도)
2. I've cleaned it 
: 청소했어(지금도되어잇어)
3. I've fixed it 
: 그거고쳤어(지금도고쳐져있어)
