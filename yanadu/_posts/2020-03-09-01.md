## Learning contents
'be able to' is a expaned expression of 'can'.

It is impossible using 'will' and 'can' at the same time.

So, 'can' should be replaced to 'be able to'

In the past tense, 'could' means just ability.

On the other hand, 'was/were able to' means that I have a ability and did that.

## Examples
1. I'll be able to go there 
: 나 거기갈수 있을거야
2. He was able to swim 
: 걔는 수영할수 있었어
