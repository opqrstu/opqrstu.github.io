## Learning contents
The present perfect tense has two means, I did something(I have experiment) and I do something until now(I keep a continue).

When I say something that do it until now, I need to add more expression words in Korean such as '쭉' or '계속'. But English is not. 

## Examples
1. I've seen it 
: 그거 본적있어
2. I've done it 
: 그거 해본적있어
3. I've worked there 
: 거기서일해왔어
4. I've lived here 
: 여기서 살아왔어
5. He's thought it 
: 걔는 계속 생각해봤어
