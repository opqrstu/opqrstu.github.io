## Learning contents

Who + 'be' verb can add more information to nouns. 

I can speak 'a sweet man' but, it can't add more information such as 'to me'.

I must be careful using words order and singular plural.

## Examples

1. I like a man who is in my room 
: 난 내방에있는 남자를 좋아한다.
2. I like people who are sweet to me 
: 나에게 다정한 남자를 좋아한다.
3. A man who is cooking is my freind 
: 요리하는 저사람은 내친구야
4. People who are cooking are my freinds 
: 요리하는 사람들은 내친구들이야
