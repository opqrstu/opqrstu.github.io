## Learning contents

There are 'will', 'be going to' in the future tense.

These are same meaning. But 'will' has a more feeling of immediate decision.

'gonna' can be used instead of 'be going to'. It is a informal expression.

## Examples

1. I will go
: 갈게
2. I will ask her out
: 데이트신청해야지
3. I am going to marry her
: 결혼할 계획이야
