## Learning contents

'when' can modify nouns to mean '~때, ~날 ..'

'When' or a subject or a noun can be skipped in sentence.

For example, "A day when you were here", "A day you were here" and "When you were here" are same sentences

## Examples

1. You'd better remember a day when we met first
: 우리가 처음만난 날을 기억해라
2. Days you worked hard were rainy
: 너가 열심히 일한 날들은 비가 왔어
